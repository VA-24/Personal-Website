                        As we near the start of the new year, I've come to realize that my goals for the break have largely been accomplished (see 
                        my first blog post for more information). Thus, out of pure boredom, I'm putting a majority of my time nowadays into
                        improving my 3x3 speedsolving times.

                        I first started cubing in the Christmas break of 3rd grade (about nine years ago). After learning from YouTube videos and online
                        tutorials with my dad, I was able to solve the puzzle in about two minutes, a time which I relentlessly worked to bring down (as a 3rd grader,
                        I didn't have much better to do). I quickly broke the 1:30 mark, then the 1:00 mark, then the 45 second mark, eventually plateauing at about 30 seconds.

                        Over the years, cubing remained one of my favorite hobbies. As opposed to solely investing time into the 3x3, however, I branched
                        out to other puzzles, expanding my collection by adding bigger cubes, cubes of different shapes, and more.

                        Coming into winter break of this year, I decided to dedicate substantial time to, among other things, improving my speedsolving skills. 
                        My plan was to first improve my cross-building and F2L (First Two Layers), steps which help solve - as the latter's name suggests - the first
                        two layers of the cube. After about two weeks of practice, I was able to reduce my average time by about five seconds, going from ~25 seconds/solve to ~20.
                    </p>

                    <p class='text-sm xl:text-base text-neutral-100 font-small mb-10'>
                        To further improve, I'm looking forward to learning the 57 OLL/ 21 PLL algorithms (steps which solve the remaining last layer). As I've done in the past,
                        I'm looking forward to using cubing as a method for relaxation and rewinding, albeit with (hopefully) faster solves.
